TMath
======================
A small math function collection based on the Taylor expansion series.

## How to use
You can copy the files directly into your project folder or build a library file on your own, but it is often not worth it. The library uses the types `TMath::DOUBLE`(`long double`) and `TMath::LONG`(`long long`) for parameters and return values.
